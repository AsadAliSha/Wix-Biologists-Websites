          <h3>Privacy Policy - the basics</h3>
          <p>
            Having said that, a privacy policy is a statement that discloses some or all of the ways
            a website collects, uses, discloses, processes, and manages the data of its visitors and
            customers. It usually also includes a statement regarding the website’s commitment to
            protecting its visitors’ or customers’ privacy, and an explanation about the different
            mechanisms the website is implementing in order to protect privacy.
          </p>

            Different jurisdictions have different legal obligations of what must be included in a
            Privacy Policy. You are responsible to make sure you are following the relevant
            legislation to your activities and location.

          <h3>What to include in the Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>
            Generally speaking, a Privacy Policy often addresses these types of issues: the types of
            information the website is collecting and the manner in which it collects the data; an
            explanation about why is the website collecting these types of information; what are the
            website’s practices on sharing the information with third parties; ways in which your
            visitors and customers can exercise their rights according to the relevant privacy
            legislation; the specific practices regarding minors’ data collection; and much, much
            more.
